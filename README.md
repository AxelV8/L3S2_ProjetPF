# L3S2_ProjetPF

This is one of my last project during my third years of Bachelor's degree . I had to study a calculation model of my choice. I took the Shepherdsonâ€“Sturgis register machine introduced in 1963.

The ocaml implementation of our registry machine has two versions with slightly different data structures. The first with a Registry Dictionary and an instruction list. The second with Two dictionaries, one of registry and one of instruction.
